The snippet `function sum() return a+b` is almost there, but it's missing a crucial piece: **where do `a` and `b` come
from?**

For a function to be truly reusable and effective, it should receive the values it needs as **parameters** (also called
arguments).

Here's a breakdown of why your snippet might not work as intended and the correct ways to implement a `sum` function in
common programming languages:

---

### Why `function sum() return a+b` might not work:

If `a` and `b` are not defined *globally* or *within the function's scope* before it's called, you would get a
`ReferenceError` (JavaScript) or `NameError` (Python), because the program wouldn't know what `a` and `b` refer to.

**Example of an error (JavaScript):**

```javascript
// This will cause an error unless 'a' and 'b' are defined globally
function sum() {
return a + b;
}

// console.log(sum()); // ReferenceError: a is not defined
```

---

### The Correct and Recommended Way (Using Parameters):

The best practice is to pass the numbers you want to sum as parameters to the function.

#### 1. In JavaScript:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}

// How to use it:
let result1 = sum(5, 3); // result1 will be 8
let result2 = sum(100, 200); // result2 will be 300

console.log(result1); // Output: 8
console.log(result2); // Output: 300
```

#### 2. In Python:

```python
def sum(a, b):
return a + b

# How to use it:
result1 = sum(5, 3) # result1 will be 8
result2 = sum(100, 200) # result2 will be 300

print(result1) # Output: 8
print(result2) # Output: 300
```

---

### Important Considerations:

1. **Readability and Reusability:** Passing `a` and `b` as parameters makes your `sum` function very clear about what it
needs and what it does. You can use it with any two numbers without worrying about external variables.
2. **Naming:** In Python, `sum` is a built-in function, so it's often good practice to name your custom sum function
something like `add_numbers` or `calculate_sum` to avoid confusion or overwriting the built-in. In JavaScript, `sum` is
fine.
3. **Summing More Than Two Numbers:**
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** You can use the rest parameter (`...args`) to sum an arbitrary number of arguments:
```javascript
function sumAll(...numbers) {
return numbers.reduce((total, num) => total + num, 0);
}

console.log(sumAll(1, 2, 3)); // Output: 6
console.log(sumAll(10, 20, 30, 40)); // Output: 100
```
* **Python:** You can use `*args` to accept an arbitrary number of positional arguments:
```python
def sum_all(*numbers):
total = 0
for num in numbers:
total += num
return total

# Or more Pythonic:
# def sum_all(*numbers):
# return sum(numbers) # Using the built-in sum()

print(sum_all(1, 2, 3)) # Output: 6
print(sum_all(10, 20, 30, 40)) # Output: 100
```

Always aim to make your functions self-contained and clear about their inputs and outputs!
